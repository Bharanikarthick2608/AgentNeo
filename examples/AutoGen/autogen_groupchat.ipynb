      "### Feedback on the Plan:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Data Collection (Engineer)**\n",
      "   - **Source URL:** Ensure that the script not only scrapes the arXiv API but also includes the source URL for each paper in the markdown table. This will allow users to easily access the original papers for verification and further reading.\n",
      "   - **Keywords:** Specify the exact keywords or tags that will be used to filter the papers. This will help in replicating the search and ensuring consistency.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Data Analysis (Scientist)**\n",
      "   - **Categorization Criteria:** It would be beneficial to define the criteria for categorizing papers into different domains. This could include specific subfields of LLM applications (e.g., sentiment analysis, text summarization, etc.) to provide more granularity.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Markdown Table Creation (Engineer)**\n",
      "   - **Table Structure:** Consider including additional columns in the markdown table, such as the publication date and a brief summary or abstract of each paper. This will provide more context for each entry and enhance the usability of the table.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Review and Revision (Scientist)**\n",
      "   - **Verification Process:** Implement a verification step to ensure that the links to the papers are functional and lead to the correct documents. This could involve checking a sample of the links before finalizing the table.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Final Approval (Admin)**\n",
      "   - **Feedback Loop:** Establish a clear process for incorporating feedback from the admin. This could include a timeline for revisions and a checklist to ensure all feedback is addressed.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Additional Considerations:\n",
      "- **Documentation:** Consider documenting the methodology used for data collection and analysis. This will provide transparency and allow others to understand the process.\n",
      "- **Updates:** If this is a recurring task, think about how often the data will be updated and whether there will be a systematic approach to revisiting the arXiv API for new papers.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion:\n",
      "Overall, the plan is solid, but incorporating these suggestions will enhance its robustness and ensure that the final output is comprehensive and verifiable. Please revise the plan accordingly and let me know if you need further assistance!\n",
